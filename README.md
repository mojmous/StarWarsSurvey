# StarWarsSurvey
A Deep Dive into Star Wars Fandom and Viewing Trends

This project focuses on Star Wars Episodes I to VI.

We will clean and utilize a dataset from a FiveThirtyEight survey conducted via SurveyMonkey, where fans shared their opinions. Our analysis of the cleaned data will address various questions.

We will explore the viewing rates of Star Wars movies and examine the popularity of different episodes and characters. Additionally, we will investigate how factors such as gender, age, income, education, and location influence the popularity of episodes and characters.

To better understand the data, we will create visualizations.

Finally, we will present an infographic summarizing our analysis.
